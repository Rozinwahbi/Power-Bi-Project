# Power-Bi-Project


**a) Data Storytelling (Communication Impact):**
The purpose of this report/dashboard is to create an informative narrative about the global meat trade. My goal was to shed light on the countries involved in meat exports and imports, the types of meat being traded, the financial aspects, and even the health considerations, including toxicity levels. The objective is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the international meat trade industry.

**b) Structure of Report/Dashboard for Impactful Delivery:**
I structured the report into four sections, each focusing on different aspects of the story:
Page 1 (Overview): This page provides a bird's-eye view of meat exporters, importers, types of meat in trade using donut plots. Additionally, an area chart illustrates how the trade has evolved over time.
Page 2 (Meat Analysis): This section delves into the types of meat being traded, including their characteristics, particularly toxicity levels.
Page 3 (Financial Analysis): Here, I focused on financial aspects, comparing budgets and expected revenues against actual values in meat trade.
Page 4 (Geographical Flow): This page features a flow map illustrating meat trade connections between countries.

**c) Explanation for Each Visualization:**
**Page 1**
- Donut Plot (Sender Countries): Visually highlights major meat-exporting countries, setting the stage for understanding the global landscape of meat trade.
- Donut Plot (Receiver Countries): Complements the sender countries plot by highlighting the main importers, aiding in identifying the demand side of the trade.
- Donut Plot (Meat Types): Rapidly displays the diversity in types of meat being traded, providing context for deeper analysis in subsequent pages.
- Area Chart (Day Number vs. Total Meat Value): Chosen to track changes in meat trade value over time, essential for understanding temporal trends.

**Page 2**
- Bar Chart (Meat Type vs. Total Meat Value): Highlights the economic significance of different meat types, aiding in identifying major contributors to trade.
- Bar Chart (Toxicity Level vs. Total Meat Value): Correlates toxicity levels with trade values, critical for assessing potential health implications.
- Bar Chart (Meat Type vs. Average Toxicity): Analyzes which meats tend to have higher toxicity, offering insights into health considerations in meat trade.
- Tree Map (Meat Type vs. Total Export Revenues): Provides an alternative visual representation of economic significance, enhancing understanding of revenue generation by meat type.

**Page 3**
- Clustered Bar Charts (Comparing Actual Values vs. Budgets/Expected Revenues): Contrasts actual trade values with financial projections, key for evaluating the efficiency and performance of countries in trade.

**Page 4**
- Flow Map (Sender to Receiver with Total Meat Value): Illustrates the global network of meat trade, facilitating comprehension of international trade relationships and routes.

**d) Validating the Accuracy of Technical Analysis:**
To ensure the accuracy of my analysis, I performed the following:
- Data Cleaning: Ensured data cleanliness and organization.
- Data Relationships: Verified that all tables had proper relationships, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
